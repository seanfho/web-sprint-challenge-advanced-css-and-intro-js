# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from a `JSON` object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Preprocessing, and JavaScript Basics.

> You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with. You are free to work with the full data set as a stretch goal.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your team lead.

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question. In addition, you may also review these questions with your mentor)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

    Accessibility on the web is, in part, a measure of how useable the web page is to all people, including those with disabilities. This includes web pages and web tools that are designed and coded so that anyone can understand, navigate, and interact with them. Choice of design can affect the accessibility of the webpage and should attempt to benefit those with and without disabilities. Accessible designs should consider and attempt to make the websites useable despite visual, auditory, speech, physical, cognitive, and other disabilities or impairments. 


2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.

    To ensure that a website is accessible developers can:
    1. Write HTML using semantic tags. Those who browse using screen readers will have an easier time understanding what is important on a webpage and also better understand the context of the information provided.
    2. Use descriptive language in the alt attribute of all images. This ensures that those using screen readers, or when an image doesn't load properly that users still understand the information the image is menat to convey.
    3. Choose color in design that isn't important to functionality of the page. This ensures that users who use greyscale monitors, interact in a non-visual way (such as braille outputs), are colorblind, or simply are in an environment with poor lighting can still easily navigate the website, use web tools, and understand and interpret important information.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

    A varible, simply put, a container for storing data/values. Variables are useful because they can hold data for us to be called on later in our code, and at the same time can be changed (or be coded to remain unchanged) or operated on to help developers achieve specific goals or tasks in their code.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

    Functions provide logical structure to programs by breaking down larger problems into smaller modules with specific purposes. In addition, functions are reusable sections of code that can be called throughout a program to complete tasks that need to be repeated with without having a rely on redundant code. Using functions in code make it easier to maintain and reduces the possibility that certain sections of code are updated while other sections are not.


You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test:watch` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Add a viewport meta tag to the head of your index.html page.
* [ ] Add responsive breakpoints to your code for 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [ ] Website is responsive at multiple breakpoints and looks good in-between breakpoints because student is using responsive units of measurement where appropriate. Student is using most semantic HTML for each element on page and has included ARIA roles where applicable (More research may be required to implement ARIA roles)  
* [ ] Student demonstrates and can explain a deep understanding of basic programming concepts when walking Team Lead through the explanation of their code.
* [ ] Use advanced array methods (.map, .reduce, .filer) to refactor your MVP code (create an array of all artists born in the 1900s with .filter, for example) - do this seperate from your MVP tasks
